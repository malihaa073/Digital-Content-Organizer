# Digital Content Organizer

The Digital Content Organizer app is a comprehensive JavaFX application that uses MS SQL Server for database functionality.
In human development, technology combines techniques, devices, and information sharing. The increased use of digital content in our daily lives has made it more difficult to track disseminated files across devices. ToÂ solve this problem, we have developed a digital content organizer that gives users a single location to safely store, exchange, and arrange content. Resources may be managed effectively by office staff, professors, and students, promoting smooth collaboration and saving important time that would have been spent looking for misplaced files.
